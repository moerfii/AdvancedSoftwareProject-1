# frontend

This folder holds the code for the frontend.  
  
`components/` holds code for individual components. There are four components - form, map and compare that corresponds to home, map and wish list screen in our app. We also created filtering components to handled filtering codes isolatedly.  
`icons/` holds icons and images used by the frontend.  
`mapViewOverride/` holds a modified source file from the mapview module, which we had to modify.
